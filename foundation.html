                        <p>
                            First official day in Korea wooooo. My skin and hair love the humidity, I feel like it’s glowing here lowkey. What a
                            slay. Started today getting up at 8, so the jet lag didn’t really hit which was great. I had a little bit of a nibble in
                            the lounge from the hotel, making little baguette pieces with jam and meat, in my charcuterie area. It was good, but I
                            wanted to go get some other food and hit up some cafes.

                        <p>
                            So, that is what we did. We went and took the subway to Hongdae, where we went to the Coconutbox Cafe and Gallery. Looking
                            at the pics online, it seemed really cool, but it really couldn’t capture what the inside looked like. It was so cool,
                            the seating areas were so cool to see, and there was so much variation. The gallery itself was also cool, with an
                            immersive lightroom and a gigantic ball pit. And the drinks there were also good and unique. There was a mangosteen
                            drink, but I didn’t try it, maybe next time. Instead, I got a drink called a peach crush, which was under non-alcoholic,
                            so it tasted like a cocktail without alcohol. We were there for a good hour and a half, where I just went and continued
                            working on the blog.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            After, I got to explore more of the shopping in Honda, bought some clothes, took some cute pics in the photo booths, and
                            had a little nibble too. There was this marshmallow toasted ice cream stand which sounded really good, but the place we
                            went lowkey didn’t do it really well. They didn’t toast it enough, and it just didn’t taste as good as it looked. Very
                            much more of an aesthetic type of thing than yummy. It was really sweet and the ice cream block was frozen solid.

                            On the way to brunch, there might have been a pit stop… Pop Mart!! But after that, we went to brunch. I picked out this
                            place called Hooligan Coffee, where they had Western food. I got a lunch combo where I could pick a meal and two sides
                            with a drink too. So I got pasta and meatball, scrambled egg on toast, and French fries with a matcha latte. The vibes
                            of the cafe were really nice, it was on the smaller side but the decor was really nice. The food was good too, they were
                            all just elevated a bit more for the simplicity of which which was really nice. And the matcha tasted good too.

                            That was the end of our little Hongdae trip as we went back to Myeongdong afterward. I split up with Mom and Dad for a
                            bit, went to a cafe, and coded more too. I picked one called Angel-in-us Coffee, where I went and got a citrus
                            grapefruit tea with coconut jelly. It was a really refreshing drink and tasted good. The only downside to the cafe was
                            that the wifi there did not work one bit, so I used some random one instead not affiliated with the cafe. So fingers
                            crossed no viruses.

                            After some time there, we decided to go to a cat cafe before dinner. I got a peach black tea there and spent a good two
                            hours there. The cats were quite weepy when we got there, but I did have some good petting time with the cats and read
                            just a little bit. The current read is “Men Who Hate Women” by Laura Bates. So far, it seems really interesting so I
                            can’t wait to dig into it more. Not only were the cats feeling a little eepy, but I also started feeling a little bit
                            eepy too. But I was chilling. Dad on the other hand was taking a little nap in the cat cafe.

                            So, we went to dinner so we could get back to the hotel and he could sleep early… but... I might have made some pit
                            stops and bought some clothes teehee. We did make it to dinner though, and saw some stray cats at the pagoda behind the
                            hotel on the way. We ate some kbbq at this place called Geumnyeong Hanu Korean BBQ City Hall. It was rated well, and
                            tasted quite good. I with the menu was a bit more expansive though, there was like I think four types of meat we could
                            actually bbq. It was good the marinated ribs we had, but yeah just hoping a bit more.

                            We got to our hotel, which is right next to Myeongdong,
                            which is perfect for some shopping!!! I don't know how I'm not tired,
                            but I was ready to go out and shop, eat, and go to cafes, which is what
                            happened. Dad and I went to Myeongdong and went to some photo booths, looked
                            in some stores, and went to our first cafe already. We went to Cafe Mignon,
                            where I got a chocolate tart and a yogurt smoothie. I've been missing Asian
                            yogurt so badly, and it tasted really good. There, I worked a bit on the blog
                            teehee. After that, we went and walked some more. We passed by so many cat cafes,
                            I can't wait to go in a few days to them! We spent a good 2 and a half hours outside,
                            buying a little bit of clothes and spending a band on Pop Mart. For some snacks,
                            I got some honey chicken, and also some fresh watermelon juice. They both hit the spot.

                            Since we came in quite late, this was all we were able to go to. But I am excited

                            First official full day in New York!!! We started off the day great by getting bagels, the first bagels I've gotten in

                            We got 3 bagels, plain, everything, and poppy seed bagel.
                            We also got a scallion cream cheese with it. And of course,
                            to enjoy it, we had to walk to Cetral Park, which was only another
                            10 ish minutes away. We didn't go too deep inside, just on the edge where we were near 
                            a dog area. There, we cracked open the bagels. The scallion cream cheese was not really my type
                            of vibe, but the plain bagel was really, really good. With the bagels I've had in the past, I didn't really
                            ever like them, but this was really good. The bagel was all crispy, fresh, and nice. I liked seeing the squirrels in the park,
                            the last time I saw any it was back in Davis. When we were walking from the bagel place to central park, we passed by a coffee
                            shop that we ended up going into on the way back to the Sunday market called Mast Market. The Sunday market was so fun to look through. I ended
                            up getting little stackable rings, and these really fun sunglasses that say bad boy on them.

                            We couldn't go back to the hotel though until we had one more stop, which was to Magnolias. There, we got their
                            infamous banana pudding, and I got a blueberry lemonade. These were perfect to have as a snack on a warm day. Then, it
                            was on our way back to the hotel, and by now it was barely 1pm. Quick break and cool down in the hotel, and then off to Soho we go!

                            The first place that we hit up in Soho was Matchaful. The inside was really nice, though I wish it was bigger so we could sit inside.
                            I got an immunity elixer, which was matcha with turmeric and ginger, just to try something new. It was really good, but a little strong. Something that
                            I did really like though. Clara and I sat outside and read for a little while we continued sipping.

                            Afterwards, we went and looked at some of the shopping throughout Soho. Went into some stores here and there, but we didn't really get anything. Our next cafe
                            that we did stop at though, was one recommended by Nica's friend. It seems like a chain as I've seen many more on my maps 
                            throughout. At Maman, I got an iced chai,
                            but was too late for food as the kitchen closed. At this location, it was connected to a little store with stationary and gift-like things. The interior was really cute 
                            and they had an outdoor seating with flowers but it had rained earlier.

                        <p>
                            We just continued walking throughout Soho a bit more before we decided to get an early dinner, which was a good idea. We
                            went to eat at Raku, a Japanese place where they are known for their homemade udon. We were lucky as we only needed to wait 10
                            minutes for a table as they switched to their dinner items.
                            I got their duck udon which was really good, and we had some of their gyozas which were also good. Would totally
                            recommend eating here once.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <p>
                            We couldn't leave and go back to the hotel without dessert of course. We went to Sweet Rehab, where we got dessert, tea,
                            and read.
                            I got a jasmine tea and a vanilla eclair. Lowkey, this place was really pricey for their items, so I had hoped for how
                            it would be but it turned out more mid than I thought.
                            Like the eclair was okay, I've had better though, to be honest, and the tea was, well, tea. So it was fine, but I
                            probably won't come back there
                            if I visit New York again.

                            Pierce joining us and we will go to a few more places.

                        <p> This is going to be my very first blog post!!! And what better way to start it out than with New York out of
                            all places. This was going to be a cafe-focused blog, but I feel like with New York, I gotta
                            talk about the food too. I was able to go to so many good places, so hopefully these will give you some good
                            recommendations if you end up going to New York too.

                            On the first day, Clara and I arrived around evening time and went straight to the hotel first. We stayed 
                            at the Lucerne Hotel on the Upper West Side. 
                            I actually really enjoyed where we stayed at since it was a good area to walk around and we were also close
                            to a subway station, 79th Street, to be exact. It was also a hotel that we were able to check in being under 21.

                            The first place we went to in New York was a bubble tea shop. We decided to stop
                            by before going to dinner and it was such a cool experience. We got a mango fruit tea with 
                            boba in it. The drink itself was good, the boba though wasn't the best to be honest. The decorations
                            inside though, were very cool. There was this pink phone booth with a hidden door that led to
                             a speakeasy which I thought was really cool.

                           Afterwards, we took the subway south of New York and went closer to the pier. here, we stopped by and got some cookies at 
                           Funny Face Bakery.

                            They had really funny and cunty designs on their cookies which were so fun. We ended up getting like a banana toffee cookie
                            that tasted lowkey fire. Then we walked more to the pier where we went and got dinner
                            at Mister Dips. I got their chicken sandwich which hit different. Clara got their strawberry-dipped cone which I tried. I'm not really a fan of dipped ice cream, but the ice cream itself was good. After all of this, 
                            we did see a gelato stand on the pier... so of course we had to get gelato too. I got strawberry and yogurt flavoured and they were really good.
