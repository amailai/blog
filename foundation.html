                        <h1>Vietnam D4</h1>

                        <p>
                            Woke up today late… oops. I was supposed to get up at 7 to get and get ready to get bánh cuốn with Phine and Hieu at 8
                            but I got up at 8:30. So instead, they brought bánh cuốn to Cat Linh instead. So I got to Cat Linh and ate there.
                        </p>

                        <br> 

                        <div class="address-container seperate">
                            <p><u>LeuLeu Accessorize</u> </p>
                            <p>77F P. Đặng Văn Ngữ, Trung Tự, Đống Đa, Hà Nội, Vietnam</p>
                            <p><u>ZIOHAIR Nguyễn Hy Quang</u> </p>
                            <p>69 P. Nguyễn Hy Quang, Chợ Dừa, Đống Đa, Hà Nội, Vietnam</p>
                        </div>

                        <p> 
                            Then, Phine, Co Nhung, and I went out and bought some accessories and bathing suit fit which were really cute at this
                            accessories place called LeuLeu Accessorize. Then, we were on our way to the hair salon. I wanted to ge my hair permed
                            and cut, but they couldn’t do that on the leftover bleached parts of my hair cause it was still too weak. So instead,
                            they went and redid my bleached parts, but ended up putting the dye all the way to my roots which I didn’t really want.
                            They ended up doing a blue like last time, but this one is a deeper and darker blue colour which I liked. And then after
                            the dye they washed it out and did treatment, and then cut my hair. This ended up taking like I think 3 hours for me,
                            3.5 ish. I had a sữa chua đánh đá while getting my hair done, it was okay.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Afterwards, I went back to the hotel to go to Lotte in Tay Ho with Jon and Dad at 2:30. We went there, walked around.
                            Jon got a top and I got some shoes for the gym. We then stopped in Starbucks so Dad could get Mom some tumblers. And
                            then we were done at around 4:30. So, cause we had time before dinner, I decided to go to one of the cafes I had down on
                            my map out of the hundreds I have marked down.
                        </p>

                        <div class="address-container seperate">
                            <p><u>The Little Plan café - Kế Hoạch Nhỏ café</u></p>
                            <p>11 Phủ Doãn Hà Nội Hanoi City, 110212, Vietnam</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            I ended up picking one close-ish to Hoan Kiem called The Little Plan, and took a taxi there. The cafe was really nice,
                            it was easy to find by just walking down the alley a bit and going up the stairs. The door needs a little push to get in
                            for sure, but the vibes were so nice. There was a little upstairs seating, outside seating, and the first floor. When I
                            entered, they just baked fresh cookies which added more to the vibes. I went and ordered a croissant and a lemon jasmine
                            iced tea. I then went up and added to my typing and caught up a bit. Typing was quite hard with my nails, but I’ll live.
                            The croissant came with condensed milk which was good, and the tea was also good. Yeah, the vibes here were really nice,
                            would totally come back.

                            After, I went back to Cat Linh so we could leave to go to Brazilian. It took some time, but we finally got there and had
                            dinner. Ate a lot of meat, it was nice being back. Then I went back to Cat Line to chill and hang out a little with
                            Opal. Then at 9:30, I went back to the hotel. I was going to just check out the gym, but it was a lot nicer than I
                            thought. There were cables and leg machines and dumbbells that I actually ended up just hitting glutes and a bit of abs.
                            I was sweating so much though. Then I went back to the room and that wraps up today.

                            Woke up today and got ready. Phine and I walked to Highlands Coffee by Pullman which I’ve been meaning to go to. We got
                            to see Mom and one now her friends. There, I ate xôi that Hieu got for us, but I had to push all of the nuts to the
                            side. I got kumquat juice to drink which was really good and refreshing. Then I just mainly chilled there, typing away
                            and on my one as the others talked.

                            Then, we went to lunch at Hanoi Hotel. It was just all of us and Mincu, and we had dimsum. I miss the old layout of how
                            they used to do dim sum Sundays at Hanoi Hotel though. Before we headed to the airport, we stopped by a cafe where Hieu
                            was. I got an iced orange peach tea with lemongrass that was good. Then we went to the airport and got Jon and said
                            goodbye to Mincu. Then back to Cat Linh we went to get our nails done.

                            I sat in the nail store from 4 to 6:30, whew, it took a while. Co Nhung got us some bubble tea while we waited for our
                            nails to be done. I think this is the coolest set that I’ve gotten, with all of the charms added on. It already is a
                            pain to type with them though, some sacrifices gotta be made though.

                            We then went to a hot pot place after for some dinner with Phuong Linh. It was a mushroom based hot pot, which tasted
                            fine to me. I just had beef the entire night. Then, we went back to Cat Linh to drop off Phuong Linh and headed to the
                            Metropole for some. Night-time drinks and dessert at Angelina. We all ordered this cocktail called Feeling Golden, which
                            had pineapple juice, passion fruit puree, honey-ginger syrup, and lemongrass. I really liked this drink, it is like a
                            combo of everything refreshing that I like in one. In addition, I also ordered truffle fries and a dessert called
                            extravaganza chocolate which contained chocolate and vanilla ice cream and brownie. The fries were good, the dessert was
                            okay, not my favourite to be honest.

                            We then headed back and I came back to the hotel and got ready to sleep. I really enjoyed going back to Highlands
                            Coffee, I need to stop by again before leaving for sure. I like the pastries they have and the drinks, and it is a chain
                            which is nice.

                            Woke up today at Co Xuan’s apartment wooooo. Went and got ready and ended up having pho for breakfast. I got phở chín
                            for breakfast and ate that up in like 1 minute. Gobbled it all down. Phine and I then went to Lotte in Tay Ho, the one
                            that was finally built after like 10 years. There, we walked around, and went to some stores. I got a drink from this
                            one place called TEAZY. I got their mango peach magic drink, and Phine got their pandan drink (green rice bubble). We
                            took some pics in the photobooth and then went to do laser hair removal.

                            After that, Phine and I went to meet up with Co Lan and one of Mom’s friend in the Metropole hotel for high tea. We
                            spent a good hour and a half there and had some snacks and pastries. Their scones were really good, I had 2 with their
                            butter and jam and it was yummy. I also liked the cream puff they had and the fresh mango. For drinks, I got a drink
                            under their detox tea. I kept trying to find out the name directly but I can’t find the drinks menu online, but I
                            basically got a kumquat, lemongrass, ginger drink with jasmine tea. Whatever the combo actually was, it was really,
                            really good I wouldd totally get it again.

                            Then, we went back to Cat Linh where I was able to see Opal. Baby is so big and fat and I miss her. We went and rested
                            before going to the old quarter and Hoan Kiem at 6:30 with Hieu.

                            time, and we walked around. We looked through some shopping stuff, but mainly walked around and stopped in International
                            street where we sat to the side and vibed. I got a coke and we had some sausages and chilled.
                            We then walked to go and get fried rice, and we sat there and ate for a bit. Watched some basketball in the TV, Hanoi
                            Buffalos against Saigon Heat. We won woooo. After that, we went and walked to bingsu. We got a mango bingsu and I got a

                            Woke up and basically just went to the airport. There, we checked in and did everything but were lowkey running a little
                            on time so we couldn’t go to the lounge. Instead, I went to Starbucks and tried one of their drinks. I got the Jeju

                            way. I fell asleep for probably like 45 minutes on the plane.

                            went to a cat cafe called Oleleoe Books and Cat. They have multiple locations but we just went to one closer. Inside, I
                            really liked the vibes, and the cats were so chill and nice. It doesn’t feel like your typical cat cafe which I liked,
                            it was kind of like a cafe that happened to have cats. I got a matcha drink which just tasted like matcha milk tea, and
                            we vibed the entire time.

                            the first time, and see Khoai again. I played with them and got ready for sleep and ended up sleeping at like 1 am.

                            Rahhhh last full day in Korea. I woke up today getting ready and taking the subway to go see Ms. Shim. Mom and Dad went
                            to do a tour to see the DMZ today so I was just gonna vibe and do my own little things. I went and met up with Ms. Shim,
                            where we went to the Gwangjang Market. We went and we had some traditional food inside and just chatted. First, we got
                            this twisted donut that was coated in sugar, and then this like sweet pancake that had sesame and honey in it. Both were
                            good, my favorite was probably the donut though, it was sweet and nice and chewy kind of like a mochi type of dough. We
                            then went and had some of the traditional savory Korean pancakes that had bean sprouts and mung beans in them. While
                            also having some sparkling rice wine. I don’t tend to love mung beans, but the pancakes were really good and filling
                            too. They were also gluten free and vegan. The rice wine though was not my favourite, I didn’t like how it was sparkling
                            which lowkey threw me off.

                            Then, we went and took a bus to Gangnam where we went and got bingsu. We went to this chain called Sulbing, and we were
                            going to get this blueberry yogurt bingsu, but it was already sold out. According to Ms. Shim, it was a very popular and
                            trendy flavor lately in Korea. Instead, we got half mango cheese bingsu and half soybean powder. They were both good,
                            but I don’t eat any of the cheese cause I don’t like it. There was some yogurt on top of the mango bingsu too which was
                            good. The mango was like chilled, kind of like frozen which was new to me cause usually I always had fresh fruit on the
                            bingsu. We then walked through Gangnam station a bit, and then we said goodbye and went our separate ways.

                            I then took the subway back to the hotel where I met up with Mom and dad who had finished their tour early. We went and
                            took their tour bus to the cable car where we could go see the love lock bridge and the Seoul tower. We had to wait a
                            while to go up the cable car. When we got up we jsut took some pics and went to the gift store, but that was kind of it.
                            We then went on the way down and then started walking back to the hotel. I wanted a drinkity drink on the way back so we
                            stopped by this coffee shop called Paik's. I got a black tea with orange and lemon in it, and it was really good and
                            refreshing. Freshly steeped tea, and wasn’t too sweet or anything. Mom got this one blended drink which is this fruit I
                            haven’t heard of called calamansi. Searched it up and it is a mixed of kumquat and mandarin, so I knew that would taste
                            good. That one was also really refreshing, if I were to get it I probably wouldn’t get it blended.

                            We then came back to the hotel and got ready to go to dinner. It took some time to figure it out but we finally were
                            able to make it to this Michelin star recommended bulgogi restaurant. To be honest, it was okay, like it was fine.
                            Probably wouldn’t go there again, it seems lowkey a bit overrated. After that, we just went around shopping and then
                            went back and packed.

                        <p>
                            This morning, we had a tour planned from 10:30 until around 5:30. We went to the palace and the lotus temple, but I
                            ended up leaving early cause I was getting very irritated. So instead, I went back to the hotel and got my computer to
                            do some work on the blog.

                        </p>

                            I first went to the Cafe Coin in Myeongdong. The interior was cool and they also had bingsu. But since it was still
                            early, I just went and got a grapefruit juice. It was really fresh and nice, and they also gave out vanilla ice cream as
                            a treat. The inside was very like old library type of vibe with low lighting. At left on the second floor, there wasn’t
                            really any AC, so it was quite warm.

                        <p>
                            Afterward, I decided I wanted to try some cafes and bakery elsewhere. There were these really trendy and popular ones I
                            found on my phone that wsa in Bukdong near the palace and the subway wasn’t going to be long to get there. The first
                            place I went to was the Dotori Garden. When I went, there was a line that I waited around 30 minutes for. It was outside
                            and hot. Once I got inside, you go to like a self-serve counter where there are bakery goods and a yogurt bar where you
                            can ask what bowls you want. I got the strawberry yogurt bowl with the real honey in it and I also got a drink called
                            the Alix, which was like hibiscus and apple rose. I was able to go back to the table with the bowl and had a buzzer for
                            the drink. The bowl was good, I was expecting more strawberries and more yogurt for the price tbh. The drink was also
                            refreshing. It was a good try, but I wouldn’t say it is a must go considering the wait time and the serving size for the
                            food. The interior is cool though so if you like aesthetic types of places you can go here.

                            Before I headed back to the subway, I decided to stop by a bakery as well. I went to this place called Cafe Layered,
                            where they had drinks and bakery goods, mainly scones. I got a plain scone and an earl grey scone. The plain one was
                            good, and the earl grey one I'm not going to lie, I never got the chance to try since I was just full of drinks the
                            entire day.

                            I then took the subway back to Myeongdong, where I went to another cat cafe. I went to the sky cat cafe. This one was
                            cheaper than the first one by 1000 won, but the drinks were all packaged drinks, not made ones so the options were a lot
                            more limited. The cats were sweet and there were toys and treats you could give them.

                            I ended up making my way back to the hotel stopping by a few stores where we had dinner in the Japanese restaurant on
                            the 20th floor called Sushi Cho. Usually, you would want to set a reservation, but we were able to get in just fine as
                            they did have a table. I got their tempura udon which did taste good, but for the price you can also get udon for much
                            cheaper. I think my udon was around 45 dollars and while the portions were nice, I probably wouldn’t go back for a
                            casual meal.

                            This wraps up another day of just dilly-dallying around. The places I went to today I don’t think there really were any
                            must-go spots that were food-related, but going to the palace and the temple was cool to see.

                            Today, we went to Yunnam Dong, which was recommended by Ms. Shim to me for having cute stores, shops, and cafes. It was
                            the same route to get to Hongdae, so it was easy to navigate to get there. When we arrived though, it was still too
                            early for the places I wanted to go to to be open. The thing that I learned about here, is that most places, like cafes
                            and brunch locations, open late. Usually, it is 11, but some places open at 1 or 2 which is crazy to me. So, we went to
                            another Angel-in-us cafe that was nearby. This one, man the location of this one was so pretty and nice. If you are
                            going to hit up either the one in Hongdae or Myeongdong, so to the one in Hongdae. Lots of different types of seating, and
                            the vibes were so nice. I was able to vibe there for a solid while and enjoy a yogurt drink.

                            Afterwards, we started our walking journey. I think we started around 11:30 and just went to some cafes along the way.
                            We stopped by this place called Oats Cafe. This one was a cool interior, but each person had to get their own drink I
                            got a matcha latte and vibed there more while I figured out the timing with stores and leaving to see Ms. Shim. So when
                            it was 1:30, we walked around looking to see any stores along the way and to see if they were open. We ended up stopping
                            to get a drink too at this place called Nuknok House. I really like the vibes of Asian cafes cause the outside looks
                            like a house and is like a bit crusty, but then you walk up the stairs to the second floor and then there is a cafe. I
                            got a peach apple ade, and that was good. Walked a bit more but didn’t end up buying anything afterwards. So I started
                            my early journey to see Ms. Shim.

                            I had to take two subway lines, the 2 and the Bundang line. It took around one hour in total on the subway, so not bad.
                            I was able to arrive at the station to meet up at 4. On the subway and when I arrived waiting I just read my book, so
                            chill vibes. Then I saw Ms. Shim, Lora, and Ms. Shim’s mom. We went to the subway where Ms. Shim and I ended up
                            splitting up with her mom and Lora, and we took the train one station over to where we were going to get dinner and
                            drinks.

                            When we arrived, we went to the Korean Daiso and bought some things. We also stopped by the chiropractor for Ms. Shim,
                            where I caught her up on some tea. And then we ended up going to the pork belly bbq place that she and her husband
                            enjoy. There, we ate pork belly and had a bottle of soju together. The soju here travels down wayyyyy more smoothly, I
                            get how people can get really drunk off of it. For sure halfway through I started feeling the alcohol more and more. I
                            had around 4 and a half shots in total, and she had 3. She was chilling.

                        <p>
                            Afterward, we went to some more cute little stores where I was able to get a Smitski and a Sonny’s Angel. Then we went
                            to the arcade where we did DDR. This was my first time ever doing it, and I was tipsy so you can imagine how that went.
                            Ms. Shim did 3 rounds of hard while I did the first one hard then only easy afterwards. I was struggling so much and my
                            ratings were so bad. Ms. Shim, though, was popping off. It was like a hidden talent of hers that I did not expect. Then,
                            we went to where she used to bartend.

                            She was telling me about her bartending there and some of the drinks. She got an appletini, and I got this drink that
                            the owner made which was rum and all blue. That one tasted a lot like alcohol but had this nice balance to it, and the
                            Appeltini was really good since fresh apples were used and muddled to make the cocktail. We stayed there until around 9
                            and then went to a self-portrait Photo Booth. Then we walked all the way from our location back to her apartment and to
                            the station where I originally came to meet up with her as she lives right by it. So walking off the alcohol a bit was
                            good. And then, I went back to the hotel.

                            Overall, it was so fun with Ms. Shim to catch up and just have little treats. Yunnam Dong was nice I just wished the
                            places opened up earlier so I would have more time, and the place we went for pork belly was also good.

                        <p>
                            First official day in Korea wooooo. My skin and hair love the humidity, I feel like it’s glowing here lowkey. What a
                            slay. Started today getting up at 8, so the jet lag didn’t really hit which was great. I had a little bit of a nibble in
                            the lounge from the hotel, making little baguette pieces with jam and meat, in my charcuterie area. It was good, but I
                            wanted to go get some other food and hit up some cafes.

                        <p>
                            So, that is what we did. We went and took the subway to Hongdae, where we went to the Coconutbox Cafe and Gallery. Looking
                            at the pics online, it seemed really cool, but it really couldn’t capture what the inside looked like. It was so cool,
                            the seating areas were so cool to see, and there was so much variation. The gallery itself was also cool, with an
                            immersive lightroom and a gigantic ball pit. And the drinks there were also good and unique. There was a mangosteen
                            drink, but I didn’t try it, maybe next time. Instead, I got a drink called a peach crush, which was under non-alcoholic,
                            so it tasted like a cocktail without alcohol. We were there for a good hour and a half, where I just went and continued
                            working on the blog.

                            After, I got to explore more of the shopping in Honda, bought some clothes, took some cute pics in the photo booths, and
                            had a little nibble too. There was this marshmallow toasted ice cream stand which sounded really good, but the place we
                            went lowkey didn’t do it really well. They didn’t toast it enough, and it just didn’t taste as good as it looked. Very
                            much more of an aesthetic type of thing than yummy. It was really sweet and the ice cream block was frozen solid.

                            On the way to brunch, there might have been a pit stop… Pop Mart!! But after that, we went to brunch. I picked out this
                            place called Hooligan Coffee, where they had Western food. I got a lunch combo where I could pick a meal and two sides
                            with a drink too. So I got pasta and meatball, scrambled egg on toast, and French fries with a matcha latte. The vibes
                            of the cafe were really nice, it was on the smaller side but the decor was really nice. The food was good too, they were
                            all just elevated a bit more for the simplicity of which which was really nice. And the matcha tasted good too.

                            bit, went to a cafe, and coded more too. I picked one called Angel-in-us Coffee, where I went and got a citrus
                            grapefruit tea with coconut jelly. It was a really refreshing drink and tasted good. The only downside to the cafe was
                            that the wifi there did not work one bit, so I used some random one instead not affiliated with the cafe. So fingers
                            crossed no viruses.

                            hours there. The cats were quite weepy when we got there, but I did have some good petting time with the cats and read
                            just a little bit. The current read is “Men Who Hate Women” by Laura Bates. So far, it seems really interesting so I
                            can’t wait to dig into it more. Not only were the cats feeling a little eepy, but I also started feeling a little bit
                            eepy too. But I was chilling. Dad on the other hand was taking a little nap in the cat cafe.

                            stops and bought some clothes teehee. We did make it to dinner though, and saw some stray cats at the pagoda behind the
                            hotel on the way. We ate some kbbq at this place called Geumnyeong Hanu Korean BBQ City Hall. It was rated well, and
                            tasted quite good. I with the menu was a bit more expansive though, there was like I think four types of meat we could
                            actually bbq. It was good the marinated ribs we had, but yeah just hoping a bit more.

                            it is a great location to go shopping afterwards and easy to get to to with subway. Also it is by a lot of self photo rooms 
                            which I personally like going to a lot. Another day tomorrow, though, going to some places Ms. Shim
                            recommended, and I get to see her wooohoooo.

                            We got to our hotel, which is right next to Myeongdong,
                            which is perfect for some shopping!!! I don't know how I'm not tired,
                            but I was ready to go out and shop, eat, and go to cafes, which is what
                            happened. Dad and I went to Myeongdong and went to some photo booths, looked
                            in some stores, and went to our first cafe already. We went to Cafe Mignon,
                            where I got a chocolate tart and a yogurt smoothie. I've been missing Asian
                            yogurt so badly, and it tasted really good. There, I worked a bit on the blog
                            teehee. After that, we went and walked some more. We passed by so many cat cafes,
                            I can't wait to go in a few days to them! We spent a good 2 and a half hours outside,
                            buying a little bit of clothes and spending a band on Pop Mart. For some snacks,
                            I got some honey chicken, and also some fresh watermelon juice. They both hit the spot.

                            Since we came in quite late, this was all we were able to go to. But I am excited 
                            to see how the rest of the days are going to go.

                            Day 3 rahhhhhhh. We got to see Pierce this morning which was fun. Homeboy was quite sweaty from all the travels but
                            that’s fine. The first place we went to was Buvette Gastrotheque to get breakfast. So for this place, we had to take the subway, and
                            luckily, we didn’t really have to wait too long. I got a watermelon lemonade (which I didn’t find out till later that it
                            is 13 dollars!!!) and a croque Monsieur. It was good but not my favourite thing to eat.

                            So I did in fact take my medicine here, and I did not drink enough water and was choking on the pill, so the next place
                            we went was Irving Coffee cause it was the most convenient. I got a chai, it was alright if I remember correctly. Was
                            trying not to die.

                            Continuing, we kept on walking, stopping by some cute little stores. And then we went and decided to stop by this chai
                            place. I didn’t get anything, but Clara did get some chai soft serve and a chai to drink. I tried some and that was also
                            good. Not too far from the area, we tried getting soft side, but their machine was down, so instead we went to get Van
                            Leeuwen, the salt and straw of the East Coast. I got earl grey and it tasted good but I think I’m more of a Salt and
                            Straw girly. After this, we walked to another care called Urban Backyard. I got a lavender lemonade from there and we
                            went to their seating area under the store. It was really nice and a cool place to be, though it was quite hot under
                            there. The vibes were vibing for sure.

                            Our next place we took the subway close etc the East Village where we stopped by some stores and got some more coffee.
                            There was this really cute store that I was recommended with little gift-like items called niconeco zakkaya and right
                            next to it was a Viet coffee place called Lê Phin. I got their pandan matcha there which was really good. There wasn’t
                            any seating left inside but it was a really cute small place. We continued walking down the streets, going to a few
                            different stores. And then we actually stopped by another cafe to take a reading break. I did not get any drinks there,
                            but it seemed really nice. It was a mix plant store and coffee shop, and had really fun vibes.

                            Before we got dinner, we also went to a bookstire and looked around. They had lots of options and it was very nice. For
                            dinner, we went and got pizza, my first ever New York pizza. We went and got Joe’s pizza, which was good. They did
                            only take cash but it was a nice big slice of pizza. Afterwards, we walked and got gelato at Venchi. I got mango and
                            raspberry which was also really good and a great way to wrap up the food from today.

                            that they had one with matcha as sometimes the lattes are too strong of coffee for me to handle.

                            We got 3 bagels, plain, everything, and poppy seed bagel.
                            We also got a scallion cream cheese with it. And of course,
                            to enjoy it, we had to walk to Cetral Park, which was only another
                            10 ish minutes away. We didn't go too deep inside, just on the edge where we were near 
                            a dog area. There, we cracked open the bagels. The scallion cream cheese was not really my type
                            of vibe, but the plain bagel was really, really good. With the bagels I've had in the past, I didn't really
                            ever like them, but this was really good. The bagel was all crispy, fresh, and nice. I liked seeing the squirrels in the park,
                            the last time I saw any it was back in Davis. When we were walking from the bagel place to central park, we passed by a coffee
                            shop that we ended up going into on the way back to the Sunday market called Mast Market. The Sunday market was so fun to look through. I ended
                            up getting little stackable rings, and these really fun sunglasses that say bad boy on them.

                            infamous banana pudding, and I got a blueberry lemonade. These were perfect to have as a snack on a warm day. Then, it
                            was on our way back to the hotel, and by now it was barely 1pm. Quick break and cool down in the hotel, and then off to Soho we go!

                            The first place that we hit up in Soho was Matchaful. The inside was really nice, though I wish it was bigger so we could sit inside.
                            I got an immunity elixer, which was matcha with turmeric and ginger, just to try something new. It was really good, but a little strong. Something that
                            I did really like though. Clara and I sat outside and read for a little while we continued sipping.

                        <p>
                            Afterwards, we went and looked at some of the shopping throughout Soho. Went into some stores here and there, but we didn't really get anything. Our next cafe
                            that we did stop at though, was one recommended by Nica's friend. It seems like a chain as I've seen many more on my maps 
                            throughout. At Maman, I got an iced chai,
                            but was too late for food as the kitchen closed. At this location, it was connected to a little store with stationary and gift-like things. The interior was really cute 
                            and they had an outdoor seating with flowers but it had rained earlier.

                            We just continued walking throughout Soho a bit more before we decided to get an early dinner, which was a good idea. We
                            went to eat at Raku, a Japanese place where they are known for their homemade udon. We were lucky as we only needed to wait 10
                            minutes for a table as they switched to their dinner items.
                            I got their duck udon which was really good, and we had some of their gyozas which were also good. Would totally
                            recommend eating here once.

                            We couldn't leave and go back to the hotel without dessert of course. We went to Sweet Rehab, where we got dessert, tea,
                            and read.
                            I got a jasmine tea and a vanilla eclair. Lowkey, this place was really pricey for their items, so I had hoped for how
                            it would be but it turned out more mid than I thought.
                            Like the eclair was okay, I've had better though, to be honest, and the tea was, well, tea. So it was fine, but I
                            probably won't come back there
                            if I visit New York again.

                            But voila, that was the first full day in New York!!! I would reccomend going to matchaful and getting a drink and trying out Raku at least once. For tomorrow, we have
                            Pierce joining us and more places to hit up.

                        <p> This is going to be my very first blog post!!! And what better way to start it out than with New York out of
                            all places. This was going to be a cafe-focused blog, but I feel like with New York, I gotta
                            talk about the food too. I was able to go to so many good places, so hopefully these will give you some good
                            recommendations if you end up going to New York too.

                            On the first day, Clara and I arrived around evening time and went straight to the hotel first. We stayed 
                            at the Lucerne Hotel on the Upper West Side. 
                            I actually really enjoyed where we stayed at since it was a good area to walk around and we were also close
                            to a subway station, 79th Street, to be exact. It was also a hotel that we were able to check in being under 21.

                            The first place we went to in New York was a bubble tea shop. We decided to stop
                            by before going to dinner and it was such a cool experience. We got a mango fruit tea with 
                            boba in it. The drink itself was good, the boba though wasn't the best to be honest. The decorations
                            inside though, were very cool. There was this pink phone booth with a hidden door that led to
                             a speakeasy which I thought was really cool.

                           Afterwards, we took the subway south of New York and went closer to the pier. here, we stopped by and got some cookies at 
                           Funny Face Bakery.

                        <p>
                            They had really funny and cunty designs on their cookies which were so fun. We ended up getting like a banana toffee cookie
                            that tasted lowkey fire. Then we walked more to the pier where we went and got dinner
                            at Mister Dips. I got their chicken sandwich which hit different. Clara got their strawberry-dipped cone which I tried. I'm not really a fan of dipped ice cream, but the ice cream itself was good. After all of this, 
                            we did see a gelato stand on the pier... so of course we had to get gelato too. I got strawberry and yogurt flavoured and they were really good.
